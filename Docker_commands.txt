Docker Container Lifecycle: 

    docker create 		-----> creates a container but does not start it.
    docker rename 		-----> allows the container to be renamed.
    docker run			-----> creates and starts a container in one operation.
    docker rm 			-----> deletes a container.
    docker update 		-----> updates a container's resource limits.


Starting and Stopping

    docker start 		-----> starts a container so it is running.
    docker stop 		-----> stops a running container.
    docker restart 		-----> stops and starts a container.
    docker pause 		-----> pauses a running container, "freezing" it in place.
    docker unpause 		-----> will unpause a running container.
    docker wait 		-----> blocks until running container stops.
    docker kill 		-----> sends a SIGKILL to a running container.
    docker attach 		-----> will connect to a running container.

Info
	
    docker ps  			-----> shows running containers.
    docker logs 		-----> gets logs from container. (You can use a custom log driver, but logs is only available for json-file and journald in 1.10).
    docker inspect 		-----> looks at all the info on a container (including IP address).
    docker events 		-----> gets events from container.
    docker port 		-----> shows public facing port of container.
    docker top 			-----> shows running processes in container.
    docker stats 		-----> shows containers' resource usage statistics.
    docker diff  		-----> shows changed files in the container's FS.




Executing commands in running container:
========================================

docker exec -it <Container ID> <Command>

			Note: -it allow us to provide input to the container.

docker build -t <docker user id>/<Project name>:<version> <Dockerfile directory>
